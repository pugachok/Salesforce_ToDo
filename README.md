# Salesforce_ToDo

This simple project was implemented to demonstrate the work with the LWC component, the interaction between the Parent-Child and Child-Parent components.
The project demonstrates a ToDo component where you can create new tasks, track pending and completed tasks, and change the current status of a task.
